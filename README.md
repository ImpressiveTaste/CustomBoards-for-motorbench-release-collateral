## Custom Board Files

The **`custom-board-files/`** directory contains **additional reference examples** for defining custom hardware platforms.

These include example configurations for boards such as:

- **MCHV-230V / 1.5 kW custom board**
- **Multi-Phase Power Board using dsPIC33CK**
- **Other experimental or contributed board definitions**

These files show how to structure advanced or specialized board definitions for motorBench® and can be used as templates or inspiration when creating your own YAML configurations.

## Disclaimer

The custom board files in this repository are:

- **not fully tested**,  
- **not validated**,  
- **not officially supported**,  
- and provided **as-is**.

They are intended **only as helpful reference material**, similar to the community-driven examples found in open-source ecosystems.

There is **no guarantee** that these configurations will work out-of-the-box on your hardware.  
They may require modification, adaptation, or debugging depending on your specific application.

**Use at your own risk.**
